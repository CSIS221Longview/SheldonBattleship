Sheldon's Battleship Project

Still in progress. (Methods setShips() and getRowLetter(int i) inspired by Nick's and Adam's: makeShips() and getLetter(int i) methods, respectively.)

Trying to figure out my own way to randomly place ships on board and use playerGuess() for hits and misses for displaying a new board each time.
